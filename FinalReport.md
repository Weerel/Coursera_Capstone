## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
It is very important to find a good place where to live, where to do business. Computer science definitely can help it. This research investigates how to build recommendations systems, that can be applied to any large city and provide information about most suitable areas to do the activities for it's users. The city of Toronto is an example how to do it. The key feature is capturing all available venues data around the city. Foursquare location data is a good opportunity fastly collect all the data. The problem to be solved is to find districts with the most advanced infrastructure. All needed places must be close with good variety. Then districts can be clustered for areas with life quality and business value above average. After all customer can explore the map with areas highlighted for their requirements. So the target audience both as small business as ordinary citizens. One can explore the map to find best places for renting.
